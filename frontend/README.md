# Frontend Development - Air Traffic Control GUI

## Project Overview
This is the GUI component of the FAA Air Traffic Control System capstone project. The frontend will provide real-time visualization of flight data through interactive maps and dashboards for air traffic controllers.

## Current Status: Planning Phase (0% Complete)
- No frontend components currently exist
- Backend ASTERIX parsing foundation is in place
- Ready to begin GUI development

## Technology Stack (Planned)
- Backend Integration: Flask (Python)
- Frontend Framework: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
- Mapping Library: Leaflet.js or OpenLayers
- Real-time Communication: WebSockets
- Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js
- Styling: Bootstrap or custom CSS

## Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install flask flask-socketio

# Run development server
python app.py
```

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for real-time data handling

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Complex real-time data visualization
  **Mitigation**: Start with simple markers, progressively enhance
- **Risk**: WebSocket connection reliability
  **Mitigation**: Implement robust reconnection logic
- **Risk**: Performance with large datasets
  **Mitigation**: Implement data throttling and efficient rendering

## Success Metrics
- Real-time aircraft position updates (< 1 second delay)
- Smooth map interaction (60 FPS)
- Handle 100+ simultaneous aircraft
- 99% uptime during demo periods
