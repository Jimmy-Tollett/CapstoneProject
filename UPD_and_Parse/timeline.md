## Sprint 2:
- Finish pulling information
- Start parsing information - doesn't need to return yet, just a system to take inputs and split them into their knowledge

## Sprint 3:
- Parsing returning (Database should have better idea of how it would like information given to it)
- Set up API site/place to push information to (Flask)

## Sprint 4:
- Cleanup code/bugs
- make the API nicer
